A simple program which toggles specific desktop color settings on or off in Nvidia Control Panel. 
- Edit the values in App.config to change what values the program will toggle
- Changes to Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma will not show up in nvidia control panel because these values are set through the Windows API and there is no way at the moment to change them through NVAPI. They DO actually apply to your desktop.
- This program only toggles color settings on your primary display. 
- I made this for myself, so I'm not guaranteeing support. But reasonable issues may be addressed
